# Currently all the PHP versions work with the composer.lock file gnerated with
# the oldest version of PHP. This means we don't need to regenerate the lock
# file on each version. This is nice because it means pulling this repo fresh is
# more likely to produce passing tests (since dependency versions won't change).
# It's possible that this starts to fail, though, if composer starts enforcing
# the composer version in the lock file (like ruby). If that happens we can
# switch to having composer lock files per PHP version (like in the ruby repo),
# or uncomment this line which will cause dependencies to use new versions when
# they are released.
# rm -f composer.lock
