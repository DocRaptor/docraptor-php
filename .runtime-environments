# Versions without patch numbers will test the latest patch version. We include
# specific patch versions to provide consistency. We include version numbers
# without the patch version in order to automatically test the latest patch
# version of each minor version.
# Oldest last, because that's the default image, and we want to commit the
# oldest composer.lock file. Newer runtimes work with older files, but not vice
# versa.
# TODO: have the tests also test against updated dependencies
