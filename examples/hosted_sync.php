# As a paid add-on, DocRaptor can provide long-term, publicly-accessible hosting for your documents.
# This allows you to provide a URL to your end users, third party tools like Zapier and Salesforce,
# or anyone else. We'll host the document on your behalf at a completely unbranded URL for as long
# as you want, or within the limits you specify.
#
# This example demonstrates creating a PDF that DocRaptor will host for you using common options.
# By default, hosted documents do not have limits on downloads or hosting time, though you may
# pass additional parameters to the document generation call to set your own limits. Learn more
# about the specific options in the hosted API documentation.
# https://docraptor.com/documentation/api#api_hosted
#
# It is created synchronously, which means DocRaptor will allow it to generate for up to 60 seconds.
# Since this document will be hosted by DocRaptor the response from this request will return a JSON
# formatted object containing public URL where the document can be downloaded from.
#
# DocRaptor supports many CSS and API options for output customization. Visit
# https://docraptor.com/documentation/ for full details.
#
# You can run this example with: php hosted_sync.php
